## Overview
[README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) files play a huge role in how our projects are perceived by the outside world. Often, the hardest part is knowing where to start, and what to include. To remedy this, I studied dozens of [READMEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README), and devised the following template, which I paste into every new project to get me started. Not all sections will apply to all projects, so I usually prune some off as I go along.
